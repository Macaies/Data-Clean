## Steps Involved:
1. **Loading and Inspecting the Data**
2. **Handling Missing Data**
3. **Removing Duplicates**
4. **Correcting Data Types**
5. **Standardizing Categorical Data**
6. **Handling Outliers**
7. **Exporting Clean Data**

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Macaies/Data-Clean`
   
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the data cleaning script:  
   `python src/clean_data.py`
